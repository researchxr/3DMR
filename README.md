## üö©Key Features

* 2D Image Reading
  - Supports reading of various 2D image formats, including BMP, JPG, and DICOM formats.
* Image Information Reading and Grayscale Processing
  - For the DICOM images read, patient information can be accessed.
  - The images can be zoomed in and out, and BMP and JPG color images can be converted to grayscale.
  - For DICOM images, a slider can be used to display different grayscale value transformations.
* 2D Sequence Image Reading
  * Supports reading DICOM sequence images and extracting patient information.
  * Allows reading of sequence images page by page, with page numbers adjusted via buttons or sliders for display.  
* 3D Reconstruction Based on Sequence Images
  * For the acquired sequence images, 3D models are reconstructed using volume rendering and surface rendering methods.
  * Allows viewing and extracting the region of interest (ROI) in the reconstructed 3D model, with options to select and view the aorta and skin in different blocks.
* Volume and Surface Area Calculation of 3D Models
  * Computes the volume and surface area of the reconstructed tissue model and displays the results in a label box.
